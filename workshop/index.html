          What began as a hostile merger would end in a full partnership in the
          most powerful going concern in the world... it was one of the most
          astonishing transformations in European history.— Simon Schama, [2]The
          Act of Union 1800 added the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United
          Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.The first decades were marked by
          Jacobite risings which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at the
          Battle of Culloden in 1746. In 1763, victory in the Seven Years' War
          led to the growth of the First British Empire. With defeat by the
          United States, France and Spain in the War of American Independence,
          Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a Second British
          Empire based in Asia and Africa. As a result, British culture, and its
          technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence,
          became worldwide. Politically the central event was the French
          Revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath from 1793 to 1815, which
          British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to
          form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815.
